# NeuralNetworkGaussian
ANN using Gaussian function instead of logistic function as the activation function.

This is to implement the method of RBF (Radial basis function) network.

The cost functions are provided here to be included in neural network models.

Here gives a single-hidden-layer and a two-hidden-layer function. Two additional functions are used in them.

Cost and gradient are returned by the functions.
